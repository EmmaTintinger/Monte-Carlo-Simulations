# Monte-Carlo-Simulations/positron_injector_sim

After setting up the geant4 environment, to run the simulation, you need to create a 'build' directory and use 'cmake ..' to build the program. 

To use the GUI, after making the files, type "./sim" in the build dir. 

To run in batch mode, use the run macro as "./sim run.mac" in the build dir.
